# Stake View Dashboard

## Overview

Stake View Dashboard is a modern blockchain application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite that allows users to stake cryptocurrency, track their investments, and manage their rewards. The application integrates with Ethereum-compatible blockchains through MetaMask or other Web3 wallets.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection**: Connect to MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible wallets
- **Real-time Blockchain Data**: View your staked balance and earned rewards directly from the blockchain
- **Staking Management**: Stake and withdraw tokens with different APY tiers
- **Transaction History**: Track all your deposits, withdrawals, and earned interest
- **Multi-chain Support**: Compatible with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and TRON networks
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components built with Radix UI primitives
- **Blockchain Integration**: ethers.js, wagmi, viem
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Notifications**: react-hot-toast, sonner

```

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet extension installed in your browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stake-view-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Smart Contract Configuration

The application is designed to work with any ERC20 staking contract that implements the following interface:

```solidity
interface IStakingContract {
    function stake(uint256 amount) external;
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
    function getReward() external;
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function earned(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function rewardRate() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

To connect to your own staking contract:

1. Update the `STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `src/lib/contracts/stakingContract.ts` with your contract address
2. If your contract has a different interface, update the `STAKING_ABI` array in the same file

## Web3 Integration

The application uses a React context (`Web3Context`) to manage wallet connections and blockchain interactions. Key features include:

- Automatic detection of installed wallet extensions
- Connection/disconnection management
- Account and network change detection
- Error handling for common wallet issues

## Components

### Dashboard Components

- **WalletCard**: Displays wallet address, balance, and staking information
- **WalletConnect**: Handles wallet connection and displays network information
- **StakingCalculator**: Calculates potential rewards based on amount and duration
- **WithdrawSection**: Manages token withdrawals from the staking contract
- **ActiveContracts**: Shows currently active staking contracts
- **TransactionHistory**: Displays a history of all transactions
- **RechargeModal**: Modal for adding funds to the wallet

### UI Components

The application uses a comprehensive set of UI components built with Radix UI primitives, including buttons, cards, inputs, selects, and more.

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in the appropriate directory
2. Update the context if needed for new functionality
3. Add new routes in the main App component if creating new pages

### Testing

The application currently relies on manual testing. Future improvements could include:

- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for blockchain interactions
- E2E tests with Cypress

### Deployment

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory, which can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Wallet Connection Errors**: Make sure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- **Network Issues**: Ensure you're connected to the correct network in your wallet
- **Transaction Failures**: Check that you have enough gas and the correct token balance

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more blockchain networks
- Implement a dark mode theme
- Add multi-language support
- Create a mobile app version
- Add analytics dashboard for tracking performance
